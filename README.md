![](https://github.com/adarsh-k-tiwari/GSTRB/blob/main/GTSRB.png?raw=true)
The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011. The benchmark has the following properties:

- Single-image, multi-class classification problem
- More than 40 classes
- More than 50,000 images in total
- Large, lifelike database

## Testing Instructions

**1. Install Dependencies:** \
Before running the model, make sure to download and install all the necessary dependencies listed in the ```requirements.txt``` file.

**2. File Structure:** \
Ensure that the following files are in the same directory before running the model:

- best_model.pth (Pre-trained model weights)
- test.py (Script for running the model)

**3. Run the Model:** \
Once the above steps are complete, you can execute the ```test.py``` script to test the model:
```bash
  python test.py
```
